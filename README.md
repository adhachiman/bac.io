# bac.io
A game inspired by Agar.io, a popular online multiplayer game where players control a cell, eating agar pellets and smaller cells to grow larger, while trying to avoid being eaten by bigger players, using tactics like splitting and dodging in a simple, competitive, cell-themed environment. The goal is to become the biggest cell in the arena. 

The project "bac.io" is designed on a web-based educational game premise that will promote basic biological concepts, particularly microbiology, in an interactive game format. Developing an experience working from a perspective that draws heavily from arcade video games, bac.io is uniquely position the player as a bacterium in a microscopic environment. The core experience involves eating nutrients, other entities, and growing while avoiding bad things. Through this game-play cycle, bac.io intends to intuitively teach key biological principles including cell growth, predation in microscopic ecosystems, and what pathogens are. The intent of bac.io is to create a dynamic and manual supplement to a traditional biology classroom setting, creating a recreation of more abstract concepts into a visceral competition.
